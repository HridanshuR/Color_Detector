# Color_Detector
***A Project by Hridanshu and Team aka TEAM 5***

A simple color detector program made using Python with the help of OpenCV and Pandas

This program is meant to help identify colors present at a particular pixel in any given image.

NOTE: The image has to be in JPG format ONLY
******************************************************************
If you wish to execute and run the program, follow the given steps below to execute it with utmost ease.

**PRE-REQUISITES TO RUNNING AND USING THE PROJECT**

Step 1: Open CMD

Step 2: Enter the following command into CMD
	
  'pip install opencv-python numpy pandas'
******************************************************************
After downloading and extracting the project files into a particular location, execute the next line of commands to run the project.

I have included a couple of trial images with the project files as well.
If you wish to use your own set of pictures, make sure that the file has been converted to the JPG format first.
******************************************************************
**COMMANDS TO RUN AND USE THE PROJECT**

Define the storage path of the downloaded Color_Detector.py files in your CMD
  
  Since my files were stored in the E Drive, I accessed the project using the following commands.
       
Step 1. E:

Step 2. cd E:\Sem3\Projects\Color Detector

Step 3. python color_detector.py(or file name.py) -i <filename.jpg>

Step 4. Press Enter to execute the commands and run the code.

Step 5. Navigate through the image and click at any spot, to get the color name displayed at the top left corner of the window
  
 NOTE: If you have saved the program on your C Drive, Step 1 will be 'C:' and so forth.
 
Once you are done using the color detector, exit the window, by pressing ESC.
